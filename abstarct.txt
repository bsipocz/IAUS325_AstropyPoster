The Astropy Project: A community Python library for astronomy

The Astropy Project is a community effort to develop a single core package
for Astronomy in Python and foster interoperability between Python Astronomy
packages, and is one of the largest open-source collaborations in
Astronomy. We present an overview of the project, provide an update on the
latest status of the core package, which saw the v1.2 release this June, and
discuss our plans for the coming year. We describe the "affiliated
packages": Python packages that use Astropy and are associated with the
project, but are not actually a part of the core library itself. We also
highlight the infrastructural tools we provide for these packages.
